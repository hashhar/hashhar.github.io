I'm Ashhar Hasan, a recent graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science from
[Jamia Millia Islamia](http://jmi.ac.in). I live in New Delhi, India. I learned
programming mostly in my early teens using various implementations of Microsoft
BASIC and then later moved on to C++ and Visual Basic .NET on an assembled PC
with a Pentium 3 (533MHz) machine that had 256MB of RAM. I now like working with
C#, C++ and Shell Scripts. I am also proficient in Python and Java and am
currently learning Ruby and TypeScript.

# Why do you blog?

It's kind of a selfish reason but mostly just to keep track of the things I've
been doing and things that I plan on doing. It also serves as a great place to
share whatever knowledge and expertise I've gained through my own experiences.
Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting.
I also beleive that blogging is a two-way conversation, so I encourage e-mails
and comments, as long as they are on-topic mostly.

# Why the crazy name unrelated to coding?

For one, it's [marginally related to coding](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/184618/what-is-the-best-comment-in-source-code-you-have-ever-encountered/185156#185156).
Also because the phrase means "dangerous or unexplored territories", in
imitation of a medieval practice of putting illustrations of dragons on
uncharted areas of maps and that's what this blog tries to explore - "unexplored
territories in programming and software development".

# Where can I find you?
